This Mines Model is a model of the physical and administrative characteristics of mines. It considers a mine to be both a geospatial object (a special type of man-made Feature) with spatial properties and relations and also a conceptual object with properties for operation such, as agents with roles like "Operator", and for legislative or regulatory instrument relations, such as Permits.

_**NOTE**: This model implements no new Classes or Properties of its own - even the class Mine is inherited from the [Sites & Admin Features](sites-admin.md) Model - so it is just a profile of other models. The Classes and Properties from other models suggested for use are shown in the Overview figure about and the sample details figures below. Note also that this model is a profile of this Supermodel's Backbone Model and thus is constrained to be valida according to that model._
