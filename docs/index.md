The multi-part data model for the public expression of the data holdings of the [Geological Survey of Western Australia](https://dmp.wa.gov.au/Geological-Survey/Geological-Survey-262.aspx).

## Introduction

This "Supermodel" is a multi-part model that is used to coordinate expressions of data from multiple systems within the Geological Survey of WA (GSWA). Specifically, this model allows for:

* integration of data across systems
  * for multi-system data holding analytics
  * for system rationalisation planning
* delivery of coordinated data
  * taking data from multiple, internal, data sources and delivering it for public or analytics use, in a coordinated manner

## Overview

The major parts of this Supermodel are shown in the figure below.

Only a few of the total Vocabularies and Component Models of this Supermodel have so far been defined.

## Status

### August 2022

This Supermodel is at a very early stage of development. Currently, August 2022, work is progressing on the vocabularies, some aspects of the Backbone Model and the [Boreholes Profile Component Model](components.md#boreholes-profile).
